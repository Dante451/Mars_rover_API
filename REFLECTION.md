Can I explain what my code does?

Yes, it uses the NASA API to grab the curiosity rover photos and loads them for the user upon website launch.
Then, it searches for three photos when a date is selected.

Describe the functionality of your code and its components. How do your code segments work together to meet the project's objectives?
What was my coding process?

My coding process was looking at my previous assignments to see how they fit with this new directive. I also sparingly used chatGBT for initial bug fixes to help diagnose my javascript syntax problems (asking what is wrong not how do I fix) so I can see what I failed to do. The functionality is documented with comments.

##
Reflect on your approach from planning to execution. How did you organize your work, and what strategies did you employ?
What challenges did I have?

I had a lot of challenges understanding how to get the API, but once I figured out how to do that the rest fell into place. 

##
Identify and describe any obstacles you encountered while working on this project. How did you address or overcome these challenges?
What would I do differently now?

My HTML and CSS were strong, but my javascript isn't very good and I had to go through the notes over and over again to understand the concepts
so i could effectively apply them.

##
Given what you have learned through this project, what changes would you make to your approach or your code if you were to start over?

I would focus on the quality of the features, making sure the calendar is functional and not just a drop down menu before moving on.
While it technically works, I see a lot of room for improvement in features and style.
